==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                  *rainbow-trails-introduction*

Vim is SPECTACULAR but it isn't very kawaii. A cursor that sprinkles rainbows
whereever it goes should help.

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                *rainbow-trails-usage*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Commands                                         *rainbow-trails-commands*

                                               *rainbow-trails-:RainbowTrails*
`:RainbowTrails`
                Switch on the rainbow trails
                                              *rainbow-trails-:RainbowTrails!*
`:RainbowTrails!`
                Switch off the rainbow trails. Have you no JOY in your heart?!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Highlighting                                 *rainbow-trails-highlighting*

Rainbow Trails is fully pre-configured to display beautiful TECHNICOLOUR
rainbows both in GUI Vim and in terminal Vim with either 256 colours or
'termguicolors'. But if you don't care for the colours I have METICULOUSLY
selected for you, you can use your own. By way of example, here are the
highlighting commands for a greyscale rainbow, as if yanked from Ansel Adams's
vimrc. >

        highlight RainbowRed guibg=#808080 ctermbg=244
        highlight RainbowOrange guibg=#6c6c6c ctermbg=242
        highlight RainbowYellow guibg=#585858 ctermbg=240
        highlight RainbowGreen guibg=#444444 ctermbg=238
        highlight RainbowBlue guibg=#303030 ctermbg=236
        highlight RainbowIndigo guibg=#1c1c1c ctermbg=234
        highlight RainbowViolet guibg=#080808 ctermbg=232

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Options                                           *rainbow-trails-options*

                                                         *'g:rainbow_colours'*
'g:rainbow_colours'                    list (default:
                                             ['RainbowRed', 'RainbowOrange',
                                              'RainbowYellow', 'RainbowGreen',
                                              'RainbowBlue', 'RainbowIndigo',
                                              'RainbowViolet'])
                Rainbow Trails uses the traditional seven ROYGBIV colours, but
                perhaps that is not enough colours for you. Or perhaps it is
                too many! Never fear. Set 'g:rainbow_colours' to declare your
                desired set of colours. e.g. >

        let g:rainbow_colours = ['RainbowBlack', 'RainbowWhite']
        highlight RainbowBlack guibg=#000000 ctermbg=0
        highlight RainbowWhite guibg=#ffffff ctermbg=15
<
                                         *'g:rainbow_colour_width_thresholds'*
'g:rainbow_colour_width_thresholds'    list   (default: [0, 0, 8])
                To ensure a PLEASING balance, Rainbow Trails allows longer
                rainbows to be composed of wider bands of colour than more
                ephemeral, short rainbows.

                Each entry in 'g:rainbow_colour_width_thresholds' is one extra
                character. So for the default value of [0, 0, 8], rainbows
                shorter than 8 characters will have bands that are 3
                characters wide, and rainbows that are 8 characters long will
                have bands that are 4 characters wide.

                Setting 'g:rainbow_colour_width_thresholds' to [30, 80] will
                specify that rainbows shorter than 30 should have 1-character
                wide colour bands, rainbows that are between 30 and 79
                characters long should have 2-character wide colour bands, and
                rainbows that are 80 characters or longer should have
                3-character wide colour bands.

                                               *'g:rainbow_constant_interval'*
'g:rainbow_constant_interval'          number (default: 1)
                The main mechanism used for setting the speed at which the
                rainbows DASH across your buffer is
                'g:rainbow_constant_interval'.

                Positive values greater than 0 make the rainbow SLOWER, by
                introducing a delay of that many milliseconds between each
                step the rainbow takes.

                Negative values below 0 make the rainbow FASTER, by increasing
                the number of characters which it moves at each step. Setting
                a value of -2 will for example result in a rainbow that moves
                2 characters every step.

                But there are three further options! The first two allow you
                to make short rainbows SLOWER, so you can ENJOY them better.
                The third, allows you to make long rainbows FASTER, because
                time is money.

                                        *'g:rainbow_variable_timer_threshold'*
'g:rainbow_variable_timer_threshold'   number (default: 30)

                                           *'g:rainbow_max_variable_interval'*
'g:rainbow_max_variable_interval'      number (default: 7)

                Movements shorter than 'g:rainbow_variable_timer_threshold'
                have an extra timer interval applied, in a sliding scale
                between 0 and 'g:rainbow_max_variable_interval'. Like
                'g:rainbow_constant_interval', The variable interval is also
                measured in milliseconds.

                                            *'g:rainbow_fade_rate_thresholds'*
'g:rainbow_fade_rate_thresholds'       list   (default: [8, 30, 80])

                Each entry in 'g:rainbow_fade_rate_thresholds increases the
                number of characters the rainbow moves at each step. So with
                the default value of [8, 30, 80], the rainbow will move one
                character per step faster if it is 8-29 characters long, TWO
                characters faster if it is 30-79 characters long, and a
                massive THREE characters faster if it is 80 or more characters
                long.

4. Issues                                              *rainbow-trails-issues*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Known Issues                                 *rainbow-trails-known-issues*

1. Trails go INVISIBLE when they cross areas of the buffer with NOTHING in
   them. Not even magical rainbows can form in the ICY VACUUM of SPACE.

2. If you start multiple rainbows and then QUICKLY switch windows sometimes
   they FREEZE and become PERMANENT. If this happens, you can clear them with
   the command: >

        call clearmatches()

<   Note that this will clear ALL matches set with the |matchadd()| functions
   or |:match| commands, including ones not set by this plugin.

5. Roadmap                                            *rainbow-trails-roadmap*

I might Try Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm for ANTIALIASED rainbows. I should
also see if I can use |text-properties| to fix the no-rainbows-on-empty-lines
issue and perhaps they are also more PERFORMANT.

I'm not gonna lie: none of the above is likely to happen soon.
